# Facebook Quiz Game Automation

This repository contains scripts to generate a "Guess Who Said It?" quiz from your Facebook messages while preserving privacy.

## Workflow Overview

1. Export Facebook messages

    - Go to **Your Information and Permissions > Export your information**
    - Export messages in **JSON format**.

2. Anonymize messages (Python)

    - Run `python anonymize_facebook.py`
        - Input: Facebook messages JSON (`messages.json`)
        - Output:
            - `cleaned_messages.json` → anonymized messages for the quiz
            - `name_mapping.json` → mapping of anonymized names (`Friend_A`) to real names

3. Generate the quiz with ChatGPT

    ```
    You will receive a JSON file containing an anonymized group chat.

    Your job is:
    1. Extract only messages longer than 80 characters.
    2. From those, prioritize messages that:
    - sound horny out of context
    - sound chaotic
    - sound unhinged
    - sound controversial or cursed
    3. Pick the 20 best examples.
    4. For each selected message:
    - Use it directly as the quiz question (no intro text)
    - Randomize 4 answer options from the full list of anonymized names
    - Keep the correct name as one of the options
    5. Output everything as JSON in this exact format:

    [
    {
        "question": "full message here",
        "options": ["Friend_A", "Friend_B", "Friend_C", "Friend_D"],
        "correct": "Friend_A"
    }
    ]

    No commentary, just valid JSON.
    ```

4. Replace anonymized names with real names (Python)

    - Save the JSON file generated by ChatGPT.
    - Use `python replace_anonymized_names.py`
        - Input: JSON file with `Friend_X` placeholders and `name_mapping.json`
        - Output: JSON with real names restored (for answer key or reveal)

5. Create Google Form Quiz (Google Apps Script)

    - Create a Google Apps script: https://script.google.com/home/
    - Copy paste `json-to-google-forms.gs` into the editor
