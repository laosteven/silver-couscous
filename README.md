# Facebook Quiz Game Automation

This repository contains scripts to generate a "Guess Who Said It?" quiz from your Facebook messages while preserving privacy.

## Workflow Overview

1. Export Facebook messages

- Go to **Your Information and Permissions > Export your information**
- Export messages in **JSON format**.

2. Anonymize messages (Python)

- Run `python anonymize_facebook.py`
    - Input: Facebook messages JSON (`messages.json`)
    - Output:
        - `cleaned_messages.json` → anonymized messages for the quiz
        - `name_mapping.json` → mapping of anonymized names (`Friend_A`) to real names

3. Generate the quiz with ChatGPT

```
You are creating a "Guess Who Said It?" quiz using anonymized Facebook messages.

Instructions:

1. Use **only the anonymized messages** from the input JSON `cleaned_messages.json`. Do not attempt to guess real names.
2. For each message, generate a multiple-choice question where players have to guess who said it.
3. Each question should have 3-4 options (`Friend_A`, `Friend_B`, `Friend_C`, `Friend_D`, etc.), always including the **correct sender** from the message.
4. The output must be **valid JSON**, with the following format:

[
{
    "question": "message text here",
    "options": ["Friend_A", "Friend_B", "Friend_C", "Friend_N"],
    "correct": "Friend_N"
}
]

- Ensure all messages are included, each as one JSON object.
- The order of options can be random.
- Do not include extra text or explanations—only the JSON array.
- Ensure the JSON is properly formatted and parsable.
```

4. Replace anonymized names with real names (Python)

- Save the JSON file generated by ChatGPT.
- Use `python replace_anonymized_names.py`
    - Input: JSON file with `Friend_X` placeholders and `name_mapping.json`
    - Output: JSON with real names restored (for answer key or reveal)

5. Create Google Form Quiz (Google Apps Script)

- Create a Google Apps script: https://script.google.com/home/
- Copy paste `json-to-google-forms.gs` into the editor
